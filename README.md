# CharacterTraits

A simple file that uses a predefined list of character traits, then randomly selects three from each of positive, neutral, and negative, and displays them to the user. The user can re-roll the traits with the click of a button. 
This project is a very simple one, that demonstrates basic understandning of JS and how to implement it in a basic webpage. It's not meant to be a magnum opus, it is (I can't stress this enough) very basic.
This page is a good tool for people who are creating characters and need a few traits to give them some dimensionality, especially for creation on the fly.
